# CMS-Mini-Project
Custom Content Management System Mini Project for school built on React

A CMS (Content Management System) that allows users to upload blog posts. Users will also be able to view blog posts by other authors and filter them based on category. I use the Context API to manage the application state globally, adhering to a design pattern that closely follows Redux. Although very complex applications may have several stores, I am going to keep it simple and store all stateful data in a single global store.
